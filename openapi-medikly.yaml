  description: "The Medikly Enrich API allows you to enrich healthcare provider information
    by submitting an identifier you already have, such as the providers NPI, email
    address, phone number, or social username.  These identifiers are then be used
    to identify and return any additional information we may have, such as the demographics,
    prescriptions, referrals, procedures or interests of that provider.  \n\nEnrich
    REST API authentication is done via standard HTTP authentication. All requests
    to the API are secured by HTTPS. The API returns consistent, JSON-formatted responses
    that use standard HTTP status codes (eg. to return success or error statuses,
    see the Errors section for more on error codes).\n\nThe Enrich API is split in
    sub-APIs, which you can use for specific use cases, (ie Disease States, Specialties).
    \  For instance, if you need to understand provider behaviors for a particular
    condition/disease or by their specialty, you may use the Enrich API. The list
    of all available sub-APIs can be accessed in the left navigation bar.\n\nAs you
    navigate through the available endpoints, you will find sample code to the right
    in various popular languages. In most cases, you should be able to simply copy
    and paste this code and change the {Your API Key} string to match your actual
    API key to try out the endpoint. If you encounter any difficulties or have any
    questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n"

      All requests to the Enrich API must be authenticated. API keys are distributed by Medikly. Please contact us on chat if you want to get one. If you don't authenticate a request, you will get a 401 Unauthorized response.

      When accessing the Enrich API, include your API Key within the "Authorization" header of your POST, using a prefix of "Bearer". An example of this is shown to the right.



      <span style="color: #000000;">Your API keys are essentially like passwords to access the Enrich API, and should be kept secret. Do not embed them in client-side code or post them in publicly accessible areas such as support forums or GitHub. It is a common and easy mistake to accidentally copy and paste code snippets, including your API key, when seeking help - be sure to remove your API key and any other sensitive information before posting.</span>
