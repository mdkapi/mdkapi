  title: Medikly API
  description: >
    Welcome to Medikly’s Enrich API! You can use this API to access all our API endpoints, such as the Disease State API to get a list of providers who treat a specific condition or the Provider Specialty API to get a list of providers by specialty.


    Enrich REST API authentication is done via standard HTTP authentication. All requests to the API are secured by HTTPS. The API returns consistent, JSON-formatted responses that use standard HTTP status codes (eg. to return success or error statuses, see the Errors section for more on error codes).


    As you navigate through the available endpoints, you will find sample code to the right in various popular languages. In most cases, you should be able to simply copy and paste this code and change the {Your API Key} string to match your actual API key to try out the endpoint. If you encounter any difficulties or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

      All requests to the Enrich API must be authenticated. API keys are distributed by Medikly. Please contact us on chat if you want to get one. If you don't authenticate a request, you will get a 401 Unauthorized response.


      When accessing the Enrich API, include your API Key within the "Authorization" header of your POST, using a prefix of "Bearer". An example of this is shown to the right.



      <span style="color: #000000;">Your API keys are essentially like passwords to access the Enrich API, and should be kept secret. Do not embed them in client-side code or post them in publicly accessible areas such as support forums or GitHub. It is a common and easy mistake to accidentally copy and paste code snippets, including your API key, when seeking help - be sure to remove your API key and any other sensitive information before posting.</span>
